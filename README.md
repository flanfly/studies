Trade 30d and counter trade 1d
------------------------------
* compute momentum/ret correlation and t-statistics for high/low AR, high/low vol, bull/bear
* combine significant features in linear or more complex models
* test against binance data
* incorporate stop loss and check path dependencies on lower timescale data from binance
